Both embodiments of the new concentrator approach will provide significant advantages over the prior art in space photovoltaic concentrator arrays. Photovoltaic concentrator arrays using the new stretched lens will be much lighter and more economical than prior space concentrator arrays. Also, photovoltaic concentrator arrays using the new stretched lens will be easier to stow into a compact volume for launch, and easier to deploy on orbit than prior space concentrator arrays. In addition, the new stretched lens will eliminate the need for a fragile glass superstrate to support the lens, substantially improving robustness of the lens.","Classifications

A mini-optics tracking and focusing system is presented for solar power conversion that ranges from an individual's portable system to solar conversion of electrical power that can be used in large scale power plants for environmentally clean energy. It can be rolled up, transported, and attached to existing man-made, or natural structures. It allows the solar energy conversion system to be low in capital cost and inexpensive to install as it can be attached to existing structures since it does not require the construction of a superstructure of its own. This novel system is uniquely distinct and different from other solar tracking and focusing processes allowing it to be more economical and practical. Furthermore, in its capacity as a power producer, it can be utilized with far greater safety, simplicity, economy, and efficiency in the conversion of solar energy.","Classifications

"Method and apparatus for concentrating, harvesting and storing of solar energy",US3982527A,"The present invention, introduces (i) a reflector-heat sink panel with myriads of miniature parabolic mirrors and conductive heat collectors and (ii) a flattened focusing mirror. The reflector-heat sink panel has a transparent cover, a multiplicity of miniature parabolic mirrors to focus the Sun's rays into their respective focal regions which also serve as heat sink regions. For an efficient operation, heat generated in these regions is collected and transmitted to a heat transfer surface which is located on the backside relative to the mirror surfaces by conductive heat collecting branches and a conductive main and is transmitted to a heat absorbing medium. Another convenient way is to use the space separating the transparent cover and the mirror surfaces as a conduit to carry a heat absorbing medium and use the surfaces of conductive heat collecting branches and the mirror surface as the heat transfer surface of transmitting heat energy to the heat absorbing medium. Converging lens-heat sink panels which do similar job as that of reflector-heat sink panels are also described. The flattened focusing mirror is a thin multistep mirror which functions as a regular parabolic mirror with a relatively large focal length. What a flattened focusing mirror is to a regular parabolic mirror is about what a Fresnel lens is to a regular lens. method,
 The invention also introduces a multiple focusing method of accomplishing an even higher degree of concentrating solar energy and ways of storing heat energy at a relatively high temperature. In the multiple focusing method a wide band of the Sun's parallel rays is first reduced into a narrow band of parallel and concentrated rays, which is then reconverged into concentrated bands and harvested by a narrow reflector-heat sink panel. In another embodiment, several narrow bands of parallel and concentrated rays are formed and combined into a large band of parallel and concentrated rays and refocused into a set of very highly concentrated rays.","Classifications

Changes in the traces' direction are gradual to avoid signal reflection. Also, a patterned electrically conductive back plane may be provided in the laminate to better control the trace characteristic impedance. Where a trace crosses above a back plane opening, lateral extensions from the trace's side edges are formed to compensate for the resulting impedance change.

Cooling the exiting air obviates the necessity of increasing the room air conditioning capacity to account for the heat added to the room by the electronics within the enclosure. Further, the disclosed apparatus and method decrease the possibility of moisture condensation within the enclosure and also provide more efficient cooling than is available from prior art devices and techniques.","Classifications

System for developing real time economic incentives to encourage efficient use of the resources of a regulated electric utility,US5237507A,"The electric utility industry is inexorably being forced into a less regulated, more competitive, and more conservation oriented mode of operation. It is therefore inevitable that electric energy will have to increasingly resemble a commodity that is bought and sold on free and competitive markets. This invention describes a system and method to emulate and automate such treatment of electric energy with minimal disruption to the public service oriented utility concept. The system for achieving this is comprised of; sensors that monitor 1) out-of-doors temperatures, 2) mean power supplied by each generator in a utility system during each hour and 3) energy consumed by each customer per hour recorded in calendar-time; computers that are programed with software developed from algorithms that are described in the invention; and a subsystem that feeds back pricing information to consumers. The algorithms continuously generate demand-related hourly prices and bonus/surcharge distributions (during high demand periods), while keeping gross revenues fixed. Taken together all this facilitates inter-utility competition, minimizes regulation, impels more efficient use of utility assets, and provides economic incentives for conservation.","Classifications

The method employs a single row of red and green lights whose illumination pattern simultaneously indicates price differences from a mean price of the electricity, the size of a surcharge during high demand time, the size of a bonus stake per KWH available to those consumers with little or no increase in demand during such times, and individual bonus-surcharge eligibility during high demand times. The use of electricity can be quickly prioritized by typical consumers through the number of red and green of lights lit, steady and blinking lights, and by a variable duty cycle imposed on blinking lights. When taken together the overall economics of consumption can be communicated in a manner that facilitates complicated trade-offs in the cost efficient use of electricity.","Classifications

Quantitative supply and demand model based on infinite spreadsheet,US6078901A,"Calculating devices for non-arbitrary price determination and rational decision making. The historical problem of value has been solved in this invention. The solution represents the first major breakthrough in social science. Value is defined as the sum total of all the future benefits and losses. An infinite spreadsheet establishes a deterministic relationship--described by an equal number of equations and unknowns--between the price and all the factors affecting the price in an expected time space extending from now to the infinite future. The infinite spreadsheet expands the current finite spreadsheet to infinity. It does not assume a resale price in the determination of the price. The current finite spreadsheet for planning and decision making should not be allowed because it hides material information, namely, the future beyond the finite time. The scientific method based on empirical verification is not always applicable in social science. In particular, the solution to price cannot be empirically verified because deterministic sets of data can never be collected when the infinite future, which will never arrive, is involved. In order to carry the calculation to infinity, the inputs are expressed as approximate time-invariant variables. Since the present price depends on the future price, the calculation is done in a time-reversed fashion. The law of supply and demand, or the general economic equilibrium analysis, emphasizes the spatial dependence of the price and has neglected the importance of the temporal consideration, which is investigated in detail in the infinite spreadsheet. A quantitative supply and demand model for multiple commodities with similar functionality and with a uniform price can be constructed by summing over the quantities whose various prices are determined individually by the infinite spreadsheet. In turn, the quantitative model can be used to obtain the inputs for the infinite spreadsheet, with which it forms a new quantitative foundation for economics and ushers in a new age of social science.","Classifications

Laser projection apparatus with liquid-crystal light valves and scanning reading beam,US6183092B1,"Laser lines at 635 nm or longer (ideally 647 nm) are preferred for red, giving energy-efficient, bright, rapid-motion images with rich, full film-comparable colors. Green and blue lines are used too—and cyan retained for best color mixing, an extra light-power boost, and aid in speckle suppression. Speckle is suppressed through beam-path displacement—by deflecting the beam during projection, thereby avoiding both absorption and diffusion of the beam while preserving pseudocollimation (noncrossing rays). The latter in turn is important to infinite sharpness. Path displacement is achieved by scanning the beam on the liquid-crystal valves (LCLVs), which also provides several enhancements—in energy efficiency, brightness, contrast, beam uniformity (by suppressing both laser-mode ripple and artifacts), and convenient beam-turning to transfer the beam between apparatus tiers. Preferably deflection is performed by a mirror mounted on a galvanometer or motor for rotary oscillation; images are written incrementally on successive portions of the LCLV control stage (either optical or electronic) while the laser “reading beam” is synchronized on the output stage. The beam is shaped, with very little energy loss to masking, into a shallow cross-section which is shifted on the viewing screen as well as the LCLVs. Beam-splitter/analyzer cubes are preferred over polarizing sheets. Spatial modulation provided by an LCLV and maintained by pseudocollimation enables imaging on irregular projection media.","Classifications

This system and method by in large defines a high efficiency combined cycle power plant that is predominantly a Rankine (bottoming) cycle. Exemplary embodiments of the present invention include a load driven by a topping cycle engine (TCE), powered by a topping cycle fluid (TCF) which exhausts into a heat recovery device (HRD). The HRD is fired with a supplementary fuel or provided an additional heat source to produce more energetic and/or a larger quantity of the bottoming cycle fluid (BCF) which is used to power a bottoming cycle engine, (BCE) which drives a load (potentially the same load as the topping cycle engine). Energy contained in either the TCF or BCF is used to power the TCE and BCE respectively, but these fluids, and/or their respective engine exhausts, may also be used to support a wide variety of cogeneration applications.","Classifications

Heat recovered from the turbine exhaust is used to provide the hot pressurized water. Electrical power may be cogenerated and sold to an electric utility to provide immediate cash flow and improved economics. During the cogeneration period (no electrical power to some or all of the downhole units), the oil field can continue to be stimulated by injecting hot pressurized water, which will flash into lower quality steam at reservoir conditions. The heater includes electrical heating elements supplied with three-phase alternating current or direct current. The injection fluid flows through the heater elements to generate high quality steam to exit at the bottom of the heater assembly into the reservoir.

High water recovery membrane purification process,US6113797A,"Disclosed is a two-stage high pressure high recovery process utilizing two reverse osmosis membrane systems intended to provide very high overall water recoveries from contaminated inorganic scale-containing water in an economical manner while preventing scale formation on the membrane and prolonging the useful life of the membrane. The first stage of the process involves using a low pressure membrane system to preconcentrate scale compounds while purifying the bulk volume of the scale-containing water (using antiscalants with pH control) and combining the influent water with a recycle stream of concentrate from the second stage membrane process in order to prevent scale formation. This first stage membrane system is followed by a second stage membrane system wherein the concentrate from the first stage membrane system is treated further at higher pressure in order to provide purification of the remaining preconcentrated stream and achieve very high overall water recoveries. Scale formation in the first stage and second stage membrane systems is prevented by the recycle of ""softened"" water containing a very low concentration of scale-forming compounds and containing a high concentration of soluble salts to both stages in a specific proportion that represents an economically viable process, while ensuring adequate permeate quality. The second stage membrane concentrate stream is ""softened"" whereby hardness compounds such as calcium, magnesium, carbonate, sulphate, silica and other sparingly soluble compounds are removed by suitable device before it is recycled to the two membrane purifying stages.","Classifications

Extraction of bitumen from bitumen froth and biotreatment of bitumen froth tailings generated from tar sands,US5968349A,"A process for the extraction of bitumen from bitumen froth generated from tar sands is disclosed. In this process, bitumen froth is extracted from tar sands using a water process without requiring the use of caustic soda. The froth is treated in a counter-current decantation circuit with a paraffinic solvent to remove precipitated asphaltenes, water, and solids from the bitumen froth. A dilute bitumen product is produced having final water and solids contents of about 0.01 to about 1% by weight. This renders the dilute bitumen product amenable to direct hydrocracking. The process provides an alternative route to the conventional process of utilizing centrifuges to separate bitumen from precipitated asphaltenes, water, and solids and thus avoids the high capital and operating costs associated with the conventional bitumen froth treatment by centrifugation. The invention utilizes bitumen froth produced from a water process in which the use of caustic soda is not required. The process advantageously avoids the production of tailings sludges caused by clay dispersions. The present invention also teaches a novel process for the biotreatment of bitumen froth tailings resulting in a reduced amount of waste products and waste byproducts.","Classifications

Process for pyrolytic heat recovery enhanced with gasification of organic material,US7452392B2,"This invention is a reactor and a process for the conversion of organic waste material such as municipal trash, sewage, post-consumer refuse, and biomass to commercially salable materials.
 The invention produces the following:
 1. Maximum energy conversion from the organic material
 2. High volume consumption of the organic feed material
 3. Less pollution of gaseous products than prior art systems
 4. Solid residuals for disposal are minimal and non-hazardous.
 The conversion is accomplished by combining anaerobic gasification and pyrolysis of the feed organic material and making it into synthetic gas. The synthetic gas is a mixture of hydrocarbons (CxHy), hydrogen, and carbon monoxide with small amounts of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. An essential feature of the invention is a hot driver gas, devoid of free oxygen and rich in water, which supplies the entire thermal and chemical energy needed for the reactions. This hot driver gas is produced by complete sub-stoichiometric combustion of the fuel (CxHy) before it enters the reactor.","Classifications

Process for recovering methane and/or sequestering fluids,US6412559B1,"A process for recovering methane from a coal bed and/or sequestering a fluid more strongly adsorbing than methane (“SAG”) in a coal bed involves fracturing an injection well and cyclically injecting SAG with intervening shut-in periods. Even though the absolute permeability of the coal bed decreases with continued SAG sorption, the SAG injectivity, surprisingly and unexpectedly, increases while injecting SAG at pressures greater than reservoir pressure, but less than fracture pressure or fracture extension pressure. The increased injectivity is thought to be due to a reduction in near-well flow resistance.","Classifications

Extraction of bitumen from bitumen froth generated from tar sands,US6007709A,"A process for the extraction of bitumen from bitumen froth generated from tar sands is presented. In this process bitumen froth, extracted from tar sands using a water process not requiring the use of caustic soda, is treated in a counter-current decantation circuit with a paraffinic solvent to remove precipitated asphaltenes, water, and solids from the bitumen froth. The instant invention produces a dilute bitumen product having final water and solids content of about 0.01 to about 1.00% by weight rendering the dilute bitumen product amenable to direct hydrocracking. This process provides an alternative route to the conventional process utilizing centrifuges to separate bitumen from precipitated asphaltenes, water, and solids thereby avoiding the high capital and operating costs associated with the conventional bitumen froth treatment by centrifugation. Because the invention utilizes bitumen froth produced from a water process that does not require the use of caustic soda, it advantageously avoids the production of tailings sludges through clay dispersion. Furthermore, because the diluted bitumen product can be directly hydrocracked, the instant invention avoids the conventional and capital intensive upgrading steps, such as coking, which are required for treatment of the dilute bitumen product produced in the traditional naphtha dilution and centrifugation bitumen extraction process.","Classifications

Method and system for preventing mutually exclusive content entities stored in a data repository to be included in the same compilation of content,US7089239B1,"A web-based system, method and program product are provided for adding content to a content object stored (e.g., a custom compilation or prepublished work) in a data repository as a group of hierarchically related content entities. Each noncontainer content object is preferably stored as a separate entity in the data repository. Each content entity is also stored as a row in a digital library index class as a collection of attributes and references to related content entities and containers. As the user selects desired objects for inclusion in a content object, the system arranges the objects hierarchically, e.g., into volumes, chapters and sections according to the order specified by the user. The system then creates a file object (e.g., a CBO) defining the content object that contains a list or outline of the container and noncontainer entities selected, their identifiers, order and structure. This file object is stored separately in the data repository. An aspect of the invention is to provide permission checking. Occasionally, it may be desired to prevent certain content entities from appearing a same compilation as other content entities. For example, an author may specify that his work can not be published in the same compilation as the work of another author. Permission checking first requires associating each container and noncontainer with any mutually exclusive containers or noncontainers. For example, such association may be achieved by defining a set of rules specifying containers and/or content entities that are mutually exclusive. Upon selection of a container or noncontainer to add to the compilation, the permission checking procedure determines if the container or noncontainer is mutually exclusive of any other containers or content objects, e.g., by consulting the rules. If so, the permission checking procedure then analyzes the compilation outline to determine whether any of the other mutually exclusive containers or noncontainers already exists in the compilation. If so, then the selected container or noncontainer is not added to the compilation and the user is notified that the content selected may not be included in the compilation. Otherwise, the content is added.","Classifications

"Production of synthetic hydrocarbon fluids, plasticizers and synthetic lubricant base stocks from renewable feedstocks",US8389625B2,"This disclosure is directed to an integrated method for making synthetic hydrocarbon fluids, plasticizers and polar synthetic lubricant base stocks from a renewable feedstock. More particularly, the disclosure is directed to a metathesis reaction of natural oil or its derivative ester and ethylene in the presence of an effective amount of a metathesis catalyst to form linear alpha-olefins, internal olefins and reduced chain length triglycerides. The linear alpha-olefins and/or internal olefins are polymerized to produce synthetic hydrocarbon fluids in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The reduced chain length triglycerides are converted into polar synthetic lubricant base stocks or plasticizers by hydrogenation, isomerization, followed by hydrogenations, or by hydroisomerization processes. Alternatively, the reduced chain length triglycerides can also be epoxidized to form epoxidized triglyceride plasticizers, optionally followed by carbonation, to form carbonated triglyceride plasticizers.","Classifications

Current flow to each branch circuit passes through a sensing resistor that is connected across the gate and cathode of the associated SCR. When the voltage drop across the sensing resistor reflects a current level indicative of an ""arc short circuit"", the SCR is triggered to a conductive state. Current then flows through the bypass circuit increasing current flow through the associated circuit breaker, to thereby provide a substantially increased current magnitude for magnetically tripping the circuit breaker. Circuit breakers are thus tripped to provide protection against the hazards of ""arc short circuit"" currents that do not have a magnitude sufficient to initiate magnetic tripping.","Classifications

Biochemical treatment of bitumen froth tailings,US6074558A,"A process for the biological treatment of bitumen froth tailings produced from a tar sands treatment and bitumen froth extraction process is disclosed. In this process bitumen froth tailings, containing native hydrocarbon metabolizing microorganisms, are mixed with a growth media to form an inoculum which is then incubated under isothermal conditions for an amount of time to produce a mixed bacterial culture containing bioliquor and a water product containing a reduced amount of asphaltenes as well as solids such as clays and sands. The bioliquor produced in this process is then utilized in the initial tar sands conditioning process from which bitumen froth is produced as well as in the initial tar sands mining process via bioliquor injection directly into the tar sands formation. Because the mixed bacterial culture is made up of a number of hydrocarbon metabolizing microorganisms, the bioliquor is also used in the degradation of the asphaltenes. The treatment results in a process for decreasing the amount of waste produced in bitumen extraction processes. Furthermore, because the invention utilizes a biosurfactant containing bioliquor in the initial tar sands conditioning process, bitumen froth can be produced at lower temperatures and without requiring the use of caustic soda, as is conventionally practiced. Thus, the present invention advantageously avoids the production of tailings sludges caused by clay dispersion.","Classifications

 In this process, the off-gas from an ozone disinfection tank, after removal of residual ozone, is blended with the pure oxygen stream needed to supply the requirements of activated sludge treatment basin and ozonation zone. This blending of two streams is carried out either in pipe line or in a specially built (and baffled) vessel. The combined stream is then compressed and split into two portions. One portion of the gas is diverted to the activated sludge treatment plant. The rest of the gas is dried to a dew point level and then fed to ozone generator. The discharge from the ozone generator contains a small percentage of ozone and is routed to the ozone disinfection tank. An alternate of the system, compresses the off-gas first and then combines it with pure oxygen stream.
 A two bed desiccant type dryer should preferably be employed for the drying of the gas stream upstream of the ozone generator. A required amount of pure oxygen will be used to purge the inactive bed of the dryer.
 The wastewater first flows into an oxygenation basin, whereby through the action of microorganisms in the presence of an oxygen rich gas, the organics in the wastewater are converted (oxidized) into harmless compounds. The wastewater is discharged into a settling basin, where the biomass settles to form activated sludge which is returned to the oxygenation basin. The clarified liquid from the settling basin overflows into an ozone contact tank where the ozonated gas is introduced to disinfect the water stream.","Classifications

Blockchain identity management system based on public identities ledger,US9635000B1,"The invention describes an identity management system (IDMS) based on the concept of peer-to-peer protocols and the public identities ledger. The system manages digital identities, which are digital objects that contain attributes used for the identification of persons and other entities in an IT system and for making identity claims. The identity objects are encoded and cryptographically encapsulated. Identity management protocols include the creation of identities, the validation of their binding to real-world entities, and their secure and reliable storage, protection, distribution, verification, updates, and use. The identities are included in a specially constructed global, distributed, append-only public identities ledger. They are forward- and backward-linked using the mechanism of digital signatures. The linking of objects and their chaining in the ledger is based on and reflect their mutual validation relationships. The identities of individual members are organized in the form of linked structures called the personal identities chains. Identities of groups of users that validated identities of other users in a group are organized in community identities chains. The ledger and its chains support accurate and reliable validation of identities by other members of the system and by application services providers without the assistance of third parties. The ledger designed in this invention may be either permissioned or unpermissioned. Permissioned ledgers have special entities, called BIX Security Policy Providers, which validate the binding of digital identities to real-world entities based on the rules of a given security policy. In unpermissioned ledgers, community members mutually validate their identities. The identity management system provides security, privacy, and anonymity for digital identities and satisfies the requirements for decentralized, anonymous identities management systems.","Classifications

Deep links can be stored in a blockchain, along with related data, like the location of the device running the app. The deep links in the blockchain can be analysed to make a social network graph. A node in the graph is a network address of a mobile device running a mobile app. An edge between 2 nodes is a mobile app, which had 2 instances of the app interacting, where each instance runs on one of the nodes. The edge could be directed, going from the first earlier instance to the second instance. A blockchain can be used by a mobile app to write a deep link referring to itself. The app instance is looking to interact with other instances of the app. Another device scans the blockchain to get the deep link. It makes an instance of the app that interacts with the instance that wrote the deep link to the blockchain. The deep link in the blockchain could have associated data like the start and stop times of an interaction with other instances. Thus a blockchain can promote the direct interaction of instances of mobile apps. The logic to decide whether an app writes a deep link to the blockchain can be instantiated as a Writer. This can exist inside the app, or on the device, but outside any app, or on the network.

Secure multiparty loss resistant storage and transfer of cryptographic keys for blockchain based systems in conjunction with a wallet management system,US20180367298A1,"The invention provides a computer-implemented solution for controlling access to a computer-related resource such as, for example, a digital wallet. In one or more embodiments, the wallet may be implemented using a blockchain such as the Bitcoin blockchain but the invention is not limited in this regard. Use of the invention during the initial set-up of the wallet can enable subsequent operations such as wallet transactions to be handled in a secure manner over an insecure channel such as the interne. A method according to an embodiment of the invention can comprise the steps of splitting a verification element (such as a private key in an asymmetric cryptography pair) into a plurality of shares; determining a common secret at two or more nodes in a network; and using the common secret to transmit at least one share of the verification element between the two or more nodes. The shares can be split such that no share on its own is sufficient to arrive at the verification element. This means that no one party stores the entire private key, providing for enhanced security of the key. Two or more shares are required to restore the key. The shares are stored at separate locations one of which is an independent back-up or safe-storage location. If one of the other shares becomes unavailable, the share can be retrieved from back up to ensure that the key (and thus the controlled resource) is still accessible. To ensure safe transmission of the share(s), the common secret is generated at two different nodes independently of each other and then used to generate an encryption key. The encryption key can be used to encrypt at least one share of the verification element, or a message comprising it, to ensure that the share(s) are transmitted securely.","Classifications

A method according to the invention may comprise the step of generating a first blockchain transaction which includes a redeem script. The redeem script comprises a cryptographic public key associated with an initiating party and metadata which includes a hash of an exchange-related document; a redeem address; and an amount of digital currency. A second blockchain transaction is generated and published to the blockchain so as to spend the digital currency to the redeem address. This provides the advantage that the further transaction will be publically available and thus detectable by other parties once it has been published. The further transaction can provide the information necessary to trigger a response e.g. an offer from another (responding) party who publishes their response on the blockchain. Thus, the exchange process can be implemented via a multi-transaction mechanism on the blockchain rather than an alternative medium. The exchange related document may be an invitation (offer/request) which is stored off-block in a repository such as a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The invitation may be an invitation to engage in a contract. A smart contract (and associated blockchain transaction) may be formed upon condition that a plurality of participants (e.g. lenders/borrowers) are matched with each other via one or more responses effected via transactions on the blockchain.","Classifications

For example, the device can record and store when a user first started the device (a date and time of first use), how the device is configured (including any hardware/software identifications, versions, install dates, time when configurations or installations occurred, etc.), etc. All of the information can be collected for a specified period of time (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.), periodically, or continually. This process yields a large collection of data, which can be condensed (a record before condensing the data may be approximately 10 to 50 MB). The data may then be encapsulated in a blockchain. At least a portion of the blockchain may then be exchanged to identify the device.","Classifications

Blockchain implemented counting system and method for use in secure voting and distribution,US20190058592A1,"This invention relates generally to blockchain implementations and is suited for, but not limited to, use with the Bitcoin blockchain. The invention relates to a technical solution for managing a voting, counting, selection and/or decision making process. It can be used for the implementation of automated processes such as device/system control, process control, distributed computing and storage and others. The invention provides an event detecting, monitoring and/or counting mechanism. The event may be, for example, a vote, decision or selection which is made by a given entity. The invention provides a counting solution in which a computing resource, running simultaneously and in parallel to the blockchain, manages a loop-based operation. The computing resource continuously monitors the state of the blockchain as well as any other off-blockchain input data or source. The execution of the loop is influenced by the state of the blockchain. Each iteration of the loop that is executed by the computing resource is recorded in a transaction that is written to the blockchain. It is stored as a hash within the transaction's metadata. If the computing resource finds a transaction which contains a hash relating to the loop it accesses the relevant portion of code. The loop contains a conditional statement which enables the computing resource to decide which action to take. The condition may be dependent upon the state of the blockchain or any other data source. The action can be any type of action, on or off the blockchain. Thus, the combination of the computing resource and blockchain provide a Turing-complete solution.","Classifications

The blades are propelled by wind current such that the windmill rotates about a central axis of a shaft (20) on which a hub (64) is journalled. Each folding blade extends radially from the hub and includes a lower blade portion (24) attached to the hub and an upper blade portion (22) pivotally attached to the lower blade portion. The lower blade portion includes a hydrodynamic surface extending from a first edge(43) and terminating at a trailing edge (42). The upper blade portion is hydrodynamically contoured so as to form a nose cone (44). An apex of the nose cone forms a leading edge (40) of the upper blade portion that is opposite a trailing edge (41). The nose cone is weighted such that the trailing edge of the upper blade portion balances in a position slightly separate from the trailing edge of the lower blade portion when the fluid current fails to flow at a speed that exceeds a minimum threshold. However, when the fluid current impinges the trailing edge of the upper blade portion and the fluid current flows at a speed that exceeds a minimum threshold, the weighted nose cone of the upper blade portion causes the upper blade portion to pivot away from the lower blade portion so that the trailing edge of the upper blade portion is separated from the trailing edge of the lower blade portion at an acute angle. Accordingly, when the fluid current ceases to impinge the trailing edge of the upper blade portion, the weighted nose cone of the upper blade portion causes the upper blade portion to pivot toward the lower blade portion such that the trailing edge of the upper blade portion approaches the trailing edge of the lower blade portion.","Classifications

"Method for regulating a windmill, and an apparatus for the use of said method",US7419356B2,"The invention relates to a method and a device for regulating the airflow around a blade of a windmill. The device comprise a spoiler, which is provided with a cavity. The spoiler is mounted to a surface of the blade in connection with an another flow regulating unit, and the spoiler can change the airflow around the blade by assuming different forms. When the spoiler is in a deactivated form no particular changes of the airflow takes place, as the spoiler runs continually and follows the contour of the blade. When the spoiler is in an activated form the airflow, however, is changed in that the spoiler no longer follows the contours of the blade and creates a discontinuity or at least changes the profile of the blade in such way that the airflow conditions are changed. In particular the airflow conditions can be changed so the effect of the second flow regulating unit completely or partly is eliminated. The change of the form takes place by supplying a fluid, such as compressed air or hydraulic oil, to the cavity in the spoiler. The change of the airflow is an advantage in that is thus is possible to regulate the speed of rotation of the rotor, which the blade is mounted on.","Classifications

Wind turbine with mixers and ejectors,US20100028132A2,"A Mixer/Ejector Wind Turbine (“MEWT”) system is disclosed which routinely exceeds the efficiencies of prior wind turbines. In the preferred embodiment, Applicants' MEWT incorporates advanced flow mixing technology, ejector technology, aircraft and propulsion aerodynamics and noise abatement technologies in a unique manner to fluid-dynamically improve the operational effectiveness and efficiency of prior wind turbines, so that its operating efficiency routinely exceeds the Betz limit. Applicants' preferred MEWT embodiment comprises: a turbine shroud with a flared inlet; a ring of stator vanes; a ring of rotating blades (i.e., an impeller) in line with the stator vanes; and a mixer/ejector pump to increase the flow volume through the turbine while rapidly mixing the low energy turbine exit flow with high energy bypass wind flow. Unlike gas turbine mixers and ejectors which also mix with hot core exhaust gases, Applicants' preferred apparatus mixes only two air streams (i.e., wind): a primary air stream which rotates, and transfers energy to, the impeller while passing through the turbine; and a high energy bypass flow or “secondary” air stream which is entrained into the ejector, where the secondary air stream mixes with, and transfers energy to, the primary air stream. The MEWT can produce three or more time the power of its un-shrouded counterparts for the same frontal area, and can increase the productivity of wind farms by a factor of two or more. The same MEWT is safer and quieter providing improved wind turbine options for populated areas.","Classifications

If any systems are adversely affected, methods for repairing the damage are shared and redistributed throughout the network.","Classifications

Signature-free buffer overflow attack blocker,US8443442B2,"A real-time, signature-free, blocker prevents buffer overflow attacks. The system and method, called SigFree, can filter out code injection buffer overflow attack packets targeting at various Internet services such as web services. Motivated by the observation that buffer overflow attacks typically contain executables whereas legitimate client requests never contain executables in most Internet services, SigFree blocks attacks by checking, without any preknowledge of the real attacks, if “executable” instruction sequences can be blindly disassembled and extracted from a packet. Being signature-free, the invention can block new and unknown buffer overflow attacks. It is immunized from almost every attack-side code obfuscation method, and transparent to the servers being protected. The approach is therefore suited to economical Internet-wide deployment with very low deployment and maintenance costs. SigFree can also handle encrypted SSL packets. An experimental study shows that SigFree can block all types of code-injection attack packets without yielding any false positives or false negatives. Moreover, SigFree causes negligible throughput degradation to normal client requests.","Classifications

Historical database training method for neural networks,US5408586A,"An on-line training neural network for process control system and method trains by retrieving training sets from the stream of process data. The neural network detects the availability of new training data, and constructs a training set by retrieving the corresponding input data. The neural network is trained using the training set. Over time, many training sets are presented to the neural network.
 When multiple presentations are needed to effectively train, a buffer of training sets is filled and updated as new training data becomes available. The size of the buffer is selected in accordance with the training needs of the neural network. Once the buffer is full, a new training set bumps the oldest training set off the top of the buffer stack. The training sets in the buffer stack can be presented one or more times each time a new training set is constructed.
 An historical database of timestamped data can be used to construct training sets when training input data has a time delay from sample time to availability for the neural network. The timestamps of the training input data are used to select the appropriate timestamp at which input data is retrieved for use in the training set. Using the historical database, the neural network can be trained retrospectively by searching the historical database and constructing training sets based on past data.","Classifications

Neural networks for prediction and control,US7395251B2,"Neural networks for optimal estimation (including prediction) and/or control involve an execution step and a learning step, and are characterized by the learning step being performed by neural computations. The set of learning rules cause the circuit's connection strengths to learn to approximate the optimal estimation and/or control function that minimizes estimation error and/or a measure of control cost. The classical Kalman filter and the classical Kalman optimal controller are important examples of such an optimal estimation and/or control function. The circuit uses only a stream of noisy measurements to infer relevant properties of the external dynamical system, learn the optimal estimation and/or control function, and apply its learning of this optimal function to input data streams in an online manner. In this way, the circuit simultaneously learns and generates estimates and/or control output signals that are optimal, given the network's current state of learning.","Classifications

The method includes modeling the multi-element system by defining fundamental physical relationships between the target element and other elements within the system. The resultant system model is in the form of a set of coupled non-linear differential equations. These differential equations are then approximated into linearized models about an operating point or series of operating points corresponding to the system behavior. The linearized differential equations are then subjected to a coupling analysis. The coupling analysis is employed to determine dynamic coupling between instruments. The coupling analysis assesses the degree of observability of the system and associated elements. The coupling analysis may be based upon observability tests, gramian analyses, or modal analyses. Based upon the coupling analysis, coupled elements are selected. The coupled elements correspond to system elements which are strongly coupled to the target element. A neural network is then trained using previous process values corresponding to the coupled elements. Thereafter, present operating system values corresponding to the coupled elements are fed to the trained neural network. The trained neural network processes the present operating system values to render a predicted value for the target element. This predicted value is then compared to the present system value to determine whether the target element is operating correctly.","Classifications

In general, a one-hidden-layer neural network is trained first using labels discriminatively with error back-propagation (BP). Then, after discarding an output layer in the previous one-hidden-layer neural network, another randomly initialized hidden layer is added on top of the previously trained hidden layer along with a new output layer that represents the targets for classification or recognition. The resulting multiple-hidden-layer DNN is then discriminatively trained using the same strategy, and so on until the desired number of hidden layers is reached. This produces a pretrained DNN. The discriminative pretraining technique embodiments have the advantage of bringing the DNN layer weights close to a good local optimum, while still leaving them in a range with a high gradient so that they can be fine-tuned effectively.","Classifications

Following training, the clustered neural network computes its output by taking an ""average"" of the outputs of the individual neural networks that make up the cluster.

The output data is compared with the training input data to produce error data, which is used to adjust the weight(s) of the neural network. When the error data is less than a preselected criterion, training has been completed. In the operation mode, the neutral network of the present invention provides output data based upon predictions using the input data. The output data is used to control a state of the process via an actuator. In the retraining mode, retraining data is supplied by monitoring the supplemental actions of the human operator.

Look ahead method and apparatus for predictive dialing using a neural network,US5155763A,"A predictive dialing system having a computer connected to a telephone switch stores a group of call records in its internal storage. Each call record contains a group of input parameters, including the date, the time, and one or more workload factors. Workload factors can indicate the number of pending calls, the number of available operators, the average idle time, the connection delay, the completion rate, and the nuisance call rate, among other things. In the preferred embodiment, each call record also contains a dial action, which indicates whether a call was initiated or not. These call records are analyzed by a neutral network to determine a relationship between the input parameters and the dial action stored in each call record. This analysis is done as part of the training process for the neutral network. After this relationship is determined, the computer system sends a current group of input parameters to the neural network, and, based on the analysis of the previous call records, the neural network determines whether a call should be intiated or not. The neural network bases its decision on the complex relationship it has learned from its training data--perhaps several thousand call records spanning several days, months, or even years. The neural network is able to automatically adjust--in a look ahead, proactive manner--for slow and fast periods of the day, week, month, and year.","Classifications

A pattern sorter sorts the trend-free data into a certain number of groups. Average values of various time series data, their differences and the result of pattern sorting are input to input layer neurons of the network. The network is provided in advance with learning information of the change of TOPIX in the past. The output of the output layer neurons will be a value of prediction of the change of TOPIX. For the output of hidden layer neurons, principal components are obtained by principal analysis modules.

The central concept is to define a potential energy of a collection of memory sites. Then each memory site is an attractor of other memory sites. With the proper definition of attractive and repulsive potentials between various memory sites, it is possible to minimize the energy of the collection of memories. By this method, internal representations may be ""built-up"" one layer at a time. Following the method of Bachmann et al. a system is considered in which memories of events have already been recorded in a layer of cells. A method is found for the consolidation of the number of memories required to correctly represent the pattern environment. This method is shown to be applicable to a supervised or unsupervised learning paradigm in which pairs of input and output patterns are presented sequentially to the network.

Artificial neural network method and architecture,US5408588A,"An architecture and data processing method for a neural network that can approximate any mapping function between the input and output vectors without the use of hidden layers. The data processing is done at the sibling nodes (second row). It is based on the orthogonal expansion of the functions that map the input vector to the output vector. Because the nodes of the second row are simply data processing stations, they remain passive during training. As a result the system is basically a single-layer linear network with a filter at its entrance. Because of this it is free from the problems of local minima. The invention also includes a method that reduces the sum of the square of errors over all the output nodes to zero (0.000000) in fewer than ten cycles. This is done by initialization of the synaptic links with the coefficients of the orthogonal expansion.

By limiting the maximum value of the output confidence measure at which this re-training will occur, the network re-trains itself only when the input characters have changed by a sufficient margin from initial training data such that this re-training is likely to produce a subsequent noticeable increase in the recognition accuracy provided by the network.

In another aspect, the connection adjustment methodology facilitates robust context switching when processing visual information.

Facial feature extraction method and apparatus for a neural network acoustic and visual speech recognition system,US5680481A,"A facial feature extraction method and apparatus uses the variation in light intensity (gray-scale) of a frontal view of a speaker's face. The sequence of video images are sampled and quantized into a regular array of 150×150 pixels that naturally form a coordinate system of scan lines and pixel position along a scan line. Left and right eye areas and a mouth are located by thresholding the pixel gray-scale and finding the centroids of the three areas. The line segment joining the eye area centroids is bisected at right angle to form an axis of symmetry. A straight line through the centroid of the mouth area that is at right angle to the axis of symmetry constitutes the mouth line. Pixels along the mouth line and the axis of symmetry in the vicinity of the mouth area form a horizontal and vertical gray-scale profile, respectively. The profiles could be used as feature vectors but it is more efficient to select peaks and valleys (maximas and minimas) of the profile that correspond to the important physiological speech features such as lower and upper lip, mouth corner, and mouth area positions and pixel values and their time derivatives as visual vector components. Time derivatives are estimated by pixel position and value changes between video image frames.

The primary analyzer, preferably a data derived linear model such as a partial least squares model, is trained using training data to generate major predictions of defined output variables. The error correction analyzer, preferably a neural network model is trained to capture the residuals between the primary analyzer outputs and the target process variables. The residuals generated by the error correction analyzer is summed with the output of the primary analyzer to compensate for the error residuals of the primary analyzer to arrive at a more accurate overall model of the target process. Additionally, an adaptive filter can be applied to the output of the primary analyzer to further capture the process dynamics. The data derived hybrid analyzer provides a readily adaptable framework to build the process model without requiring up-front knowledge. Additionally, the primary analyzer, which incorporates the PLS model, is well accepted by process control engineers. Further, the hybrid analyzer also addresses the reliability of the process model output over the operating range since the primary analyzer can extrapolate data in a predictable way beyond the data used to train the model.

Artificial neural network method and architecture adaptive signal filtering,US5467428A,"An architecture and data processing method for a neural network that can approximate any mapping function between the input and output vectors without the use of hidden layers. The data processing is done at the sibling nodes (second row). It is based on the orthogonal expansion of the functions that map the input vector to the output vector. Because the nodes of the second row are simply data processing stations, they remain passive during training. As a result the system is basically a single-layer linear network with a filter at its entrance. Because of this it is free from the problems of local minima. The invention also includes a method that reduces the sum of the square of errors over all the output nodes to zero (0.000000) in fewer than ten cycles. This is done by initialization of the synaptic links with the coefficients of the orthogonal expansion. This feature makes it possible to design a computer chip which can perform the training process in real time. Similarly, the ability to train in real time allows the system to retrain itself and improve its performance while executing its normal testing functions. Because the second synaptic link values represent the frequency spectrum of the signal appearing on a given output node, by training the ONN with all N sibling nodes and using only some of them in testing, we can create a low pass, a high pass or a band pass filter.","Classifications

Sensory input processing apparatus in a spiking neural network,US9224090B2,"Apparatus and methods for feedback in a spiking neural network. In one approach, spiking neurons receive sensory stimulus and context signal that correspond to the same context. When the stimulus provides sufficient excitation, neurons generate response. Context connections are adjusted according to inverse spike-timing dependent plasticity. When the context signal precedes the post synaptic spike, context synaptic connections are depressed. Conversely, whenever the context signal follows the post synaptic spike, the connections are potentiated. The inverse STDP connection adjustment ensures precise control of feedback-induced firing, eliminates runaway positive feedback loops, enables self-stabilizing network operation. In another aspect of the invention, the connection adjustment methodology facilitates robust context switching when processing visual information. When a context (such an object) becomes intermittently absent, prior context connection potentiation enables firing for a period of time. If the object remains absent, the connection becomes depressed thereby preventing further firing.","Classifications

The neural network has a sensor for inputting a feature vector, a first layer and a second layer.

During training, the input feature vector is clustered to a declared node only if it lies within a hypervolume defined by the declared node's automatically selectable reject radius, else the input feature vector is clustered to an unused node. Clustering in overlapping hypervolumes is determined by a decision surface. During testing of the RTL network, the same strategy is applied to cluster an input feature vector to declared (existing) nodes. If clustering occurs, then a classification signal corresponding to the node is generated. However, if the input feature vector is not clustered to a declared node, then the second layer outputs a signal indicating novelty.

At the end of the teaching period, these recorded data are used as input for a method which computes new weights of those connections that feed into the output units. The method is distinguished from existing training methods for RNNs through the following characteristics: (1) Only the weights of connections to output units are changed by learning—existing methods for teaching recurrent networks adjust all network weights. (2) The internal dynamics of large networks are used as a “reservoir” of dynamical components which are not changed, but only newly combined by the learning procedure—existing methods use small networks, whose internal dynamics are themselves completely re-shaped through learning.","Classifications

Method of edge detection in optical images using neural network classifier,US5311600A,"An image processor employing a camera, frame grabber and a new algorithm for detecting straight edges in optical images is disclosed. The algorithm is based on using a self-organizing unsupervised neural network learning to classify pixels on a digitized image and then extract the corresponding line parameters. The image processor is demonstrated on the specific application of edge detection for linewidth measurement in semiconductor lithography. The results are compared to results obtained by a standard straight edge detector based on the Radon transform; good consistency is observed; however, superior speed is achieved for the proposed image processor. The results obtained by the proposed approach are also shown to be in agreement with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) measurements, which is known to have excellent accuracy but is an invasive measurement instrument. The method can thus be used for on-line measurement and control of microlithography processes and for alignment tasks as well.","Classifications

Discrete weight neural network,US4918618A,"A Neural Network using interconnecting weights each with two values, one of which is selected for use, can be taught to map a set of input vectors to a set of output vectors.
 A set of input vectors is applied to the network and in response, a set of output vectors is produced by the network. The error is the difference between desired outputs and actual outputs.
 The network is trained in the following manner. A set of input vectors is presented to the network, each vector being propogated forward through the network to produce an output vector. A set of error vectors is then presented to the network and propagated backwards. Each Tensor Weight Element includes a selective change means which accumulates particular information about the error.
 After all the input vectors are presented, an update phase is initiated. During the update phase, in accordance with the results of the derived algorithm, the selective change means selects the other weight value if selecting the other weight value will decrease the total error. Only one such change is made per set.
 After the update phase, if a selected value was changed, the entire process is repeated. When no values are switched, the network has adapted as well as it can, and the training is completed.","Classifications

Artificial neural network and fuzzy logic based boiler tube leak detection systems,US6192352B1,"Power industry boiler tube failures are a major cause of utility forced outages in the United States, with approximately 41,000 tube failures occurring every year at a cost of $5 billion a year. Accordingly, early tube leak detection and isolation is highly desirable. Early detection allows scheduling of a repair rather than suffering a forced outage, and significantly increases the chance of preventing damage to adjacent tubes. The instant detection scheme starts with identification of boiler tube leak process variables which are divided into universal sensitive variables, local leak sensitive variables, group leak sensitive variables, and subgroup leak sensitive variables, and which may be automatically be obtained using a data driven approach and a leak sensitivity function. One embodiment uses artificial neural networks (ANN) to learn the map between appropriate leak sensitive variables and the leak behavior. The second design philosophy integrates ANNs with approximate reasoning using fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets. In the second design, ANNs are used for learning, while approximate reasoning and inference engines are used for decision making. Advantages include use of already monitored process variables, no additional hardware and/or maintenance requirements, systematic processing does not require an expert system and/or a skilled operator, and the systems are portable and can be easily tailored for use on a variety of different boilers.","Classifications

Specifically, a window (520) is slid in a step-wise convolutional-like fashion (5201, 5202, 5203) across a field of preprocessed, specifically uniformly scaled, characters. Each pixel in the window is applied as an input to a positioning neural network (152) that has been trained to produce an output activation whenever a character ""heart"" is spatially coincident with a pixel position within an array (430) centrally located within the window. As the window is successively moved across the field, in a stepped fashion, the activation outputs of the neural network are averaged, on a weighted basis, for each different window position and separately for each horizontal pixel position in the field. The resulting averaged activation output values, typically in the form of a Gaussian distribution for each character, are then filtered, thresholded and then used, via a weighted average calculation with horizontal pixel positions being used as the weights, to determine the character ""heart"" position as being the center pixel position in the distribution.","Classifications

Sleep refreshed memory for neural network,US4926064A,"A method and apparatus are disclosed for implementing a neural network having a sleep mode during which capacitively stored synaptic connectivity weights are refreshed. Each neuron outputs an analog activity level, represented in a preferred embodiment by the frequency of digital pulses. Feed-forward synaptic connection circuits couple the activity level outputs of first level neurons to inputs of second level neurons, and feed-back synaptic connection circuits couple outputs of second level neurons to inputs of first level neurons, the coupling being weighted according to connectivity weights stored on respective storage capacitors in each synaptic connection circuit. The network learns according to a learning algorithm under which the connections in both directions between a particular first level neuron and a particular second level neuron are strengthened to the extent of concurrence of high activity levels in both the first and second level neurons, and weakened to the extent of concurrence of a high activity level in the second level neuron and a low activity level in the first level neuron. The network is put to sleep by disconnecting all environmental inputs and providing a non-specific low activity level signal to each of the first level neurons. This causes the network to randomly traverse its state space with low intensity resonant firings, each state being visited with a probability responsive to the initial connectivity weights of the connections which abut the second level neuron representing such state. Refresh is accomplished since the learning algorithm remains active during sleep. Thus, the sleep refresh mechanism enhances the contrast in the connectivity terrain and strengthens connections that would otherwise wash out due to lack of visitation while the system is awake. A deep sleep mechanism is also provided for preventing runaway strengthening of favored states, and also to encourage Weber Law compliance.","Classifications

Neural network for classification of patterns with improved method and apparatus for ordering vectors,US5729662A,"A type of neural network called a self-organizing map (SOM) is useful in pattern classification. The ability of the SOM to map the density of the input distribution is improved with two techniques. In the first technique, the SOM is improved by monitoring the frequency for which each node is the winning node, and splitting frequently winning nodes into two nodes, while eliminating infrequently winning nodes. Topological order is preserved by inserting a link between the preceding and following nodes so that such preceding and following nodes are now adjacent in the output index space. In the second technique, the SOM is trained by applying a weight correction to each node based on the frequencies of that node and its neighbors. If any of the adjacent nodes have a frequency greater than the frequency of the present node, then the weight vector of the present node is adjusted towards the highest-frequency neighboring node. The topological order of the nodes is preserved because the weight vector is moved along a line of connection from the present node to the highest-frequency adjacent node. This second technique is suitable for mapping to an index space of any dimension, while the first technique is practical only for a one-dimensional output space.","Classifications

The above steps are repeated with different weighted configurations to obtain a plurality of overall error values. Then, for each set of weight values, a score is determined by selecting error comparison values from a predetermined variable probability distribution and comparing them to the corresponding overall error value. A predetermined number of the sets of weight values determined to have the best scores are selected and copies are made. The copies are mutated by adding random numbers to their weights and the above steps are repeated with the best sets and the mutated copies defining the weighted configurations. This procedure is repeated until the overall error values diminish to below an acceptable threshold.

Both the primary and the ancillary filters are made out of artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Their implementation results in the filtering apparatus.

The training criterion, which is constructed on the basis of a selected estimation error criterion, incorporates the aforementioned realizations. An alternative way to determine the initial dynamic state of an RNN is to simply set it equal to a canonical initial dynamic state. After adequate training, both the primary and the ancillary filters are recursive filters optimal for the given respective RNN architectures with the lagged feedbacks carrying the optimal conditional statistics. If appropriate RNN paradigms and estimation error criteria are selected, the primary and the ancillary filters of such paradigms are proven to approximate the respective optimal filters in performance (with respect to the selected estimation error criteria) to any desired degree of accuracy, provided that the RNNs that constitute the primary and ancillary filters are of sufficient sizes.","Classifications

Software level touchpoints for an international cryptography frameworks,US5740248A,"An international cryptography framework (ICF) allows manufacturers to comply with varying national laws governing the distribution of cryptographic capabilities. The invention is concerned primarily with the application certification aspects of the framework where an application that requests cryptographic services from the ICF service elements is identified through some form of certificate to protect against the misuse of a granted level of cryptography. The levels of cryptography granted are described via security policies and expressed as classes of service. A cryptographic unit, one of the ICF core elements, can be used to build several certification schemes for application objects. The invention provides various methods that determine the strength of binding between an application code image and the issued certificates within the context of the ICF elements. A key element with regard to the exercise of a cryptographic function concerns the special requirements for the trust relation that an authority specifies for the cryptographic unit. Any function exercised by the cryptographic unit must be controllable by the associated class of service which represents the security policy. Touchpointing, both in the application and the firmware elements inside the cryptographic unit, plays a key role in exercising control over the functioning of these modules. Another fundamental requirement of the ICF architecture is that the application is assured of the integrity of the cryptographic unit from which it is receiving services. Thus, the invention also provides methods that allow a determination of whether or not the cryptographic unit has been replaced or tampered with.","Classifications

The host systems and communication terminals include data security devices each having a master key which permits a variety of cryptographic operations to be performed. When a host system in one domain wishes to communicate with a host system in another domain, a common session key is established at both host systems to permit cryptographic operations to be performed. This is accomplished by using a mutually agreed upon cross-domain key known by both host systems and does not require each host system to reveal its master key to the other host system. The cross domain key is enciphered under a key encrypting key designated as the sending cross domain key at the sending host system and under a different key encrypting key designated as the receiving cross domain key at the receiving host system. The sending host system creates an enciphered session key and together with the sending cross-domain key performs a transformation function to reencipher the session key under the sending cross domain key for transmission to the receiving host system. At the receiving host system, the receiving host system using the receiving cross-domain key and the received session key, performs a transformation function to reencipher the received session key fron encipherment under the sending cross domain key to encipherment under the receiving host system master key. With the common session key now available in usable form at both host systems, a communication session is established and cryptographic operations can proceed between the two host systems.","Classifications

Cryptographic system with methods for user-controlled message recovery,US6314190B1,"A cryptosystem is described which automatically provides an extra “message recovery” recipient(s) when an encrypted message is generated in the system. The system is typically configured such that the extra recipient or “message recovery agent” (MRA)—an entity which itself has a public key (i.e., a MRA public key)—is automatically added, under appropriate circumstances, as a valid recipient for an encrypted message created by a user. In a corporate setting, for example, the message recovery agent is the “corporate” message recovery agent designated for that company (firm, organization, or other group) and the user is an employee (or member) of that company (or group). In operation, the system embeds a pointer (or other reference mechanism) to the MRA public key into the public key of the user or employee, so that encrypted messages sent to the company's employees from outside users (e.g., those individuals who are not employees of the company) can nevertheless still be recovered by the company. Alternatively, the MRA public key itself can be embedded within the public key of the employee or user (i.e., a key within a key), but typically at the cost of increasing the storage requirement of the user's key. By including in the user's key (e.g., an employee) a pointer to a message recovery agent's key (or the MRA key itself), the system provides a mechanism for assisting a user outside a group (e.g., a user who is outside a particular company) with the task of including in an automatic and non-intrusive manner the key of an additional recipient, such as one intended for message recovery.","Classifications

Each of the generating and using stations have cryptographic facilities that securely store a master key. Two techniques are described for controlling the use of the cryptographic key. In the first, the key and the control value are authenticated via a special authentication code before use by the using station. In the second, the key and control value are coupled during key generation such that the key is recovered only if a correct control value is specified. In addition, two techniques are described for controlling who may use the cryptographic key. In the first, each using station has a unique secret transport key shared with the generating station which generates the key in such a way that it can be recovered or regenerated only by the designated using station possessing the correct secret transport key. In the second, secret transport keys are shared by pairs of using stations and cryptographic separation is achieved by using public or nonsecret values unique to each using station.","Classifications

If device A alters its operations from the limits encoded in its configuration vector, for example by loading a new configuration vector, device A will be denied participation in the network. To accomplish this enforcement of the network security policy dictated by the certification center, it is necessary for the certification center to verify at the time device A requests certification of its public key PUMa, that device A is configured with the currently authorized configuration vector. Device A is required to transmit to the certification center a copy of device A's current configuration vector, in an audit record. the certification center then compares device A's copy of the configuration vector with the authorized configuration vector for device A stored at the certification center. If the comparison is satisfactory, then the certification center will issue the requested certificate and will produce a digital signiture dSigPRC on a representation of device A's public key PUMa, using the certification center's private certification key PRC. Thereafter, if device A attempts to change its configuration vector, device A's privacy key PRMa corresponding to the certified public key PUMa, will automatically become unavailable for use in communicating in the network.","Classifications

The class of numbers used in the present invention is generally described by the form 2q -C where C is an odd number and is relatively small, for example, no longer than the length of a computer word (16-32 bits). When a number is of this form, modulo arithmetic can be accomplished using shifts and adds only, eliminating the need for costly divisions. One subset of this fast class of numbers is known as ""Mersenne"" primes, and are of the form 2q -1. Another class of numbers that can be used with the present invention are known as 14 ""Fermat"" numbers of the form 2q +1.

If Alice and Bob are two parties who share the password P one embodiment of the system involves the following steps: (1) Alice generates a random public key E, encrypts it with P and sends P(E) to Bob; (2) Bob decrypts to get E, encrypts a random secret key R with E and sends E(R) to Alice; (3) Alice decrypts to get R, generates a random challenge CA and sends R(CA) to Bob; (4) Bob decrypts to get CA, generates a random challenge CB and sends R(CA, CB) to Alice; (5) Alice decrypts to get (CA, CB), compares the first against the challenge and sends R(CB) to Bob if they are equal; (6) Bob decrypts and compares with the earlier challenge; and (7) Alice and Bob can use R as a shared secret key to protect the session.","Classifications

Hardware-level mitigation and DPA countermeasures for cryptographic devices,US6654884B2,"Differential power analysis is a powerful cryptanalytic method that can be used to extract secret keys from cryptographic hardware during operation. To reduce the risk of compromise, cryptographic hardware can employ countermeasures to reduce the amount of secret information that can be deduced by power consumption measurements during processing. Such countermeasures can include balancing circuitry inside a cryptographic hardware device to reduce the amount of variation in power consumption that is correlated to data parameters being manipulated. This can be facilitated by using a constant-Hamming-weight representation when representing and manipulating secret parameters. Low-level operation modules, such as Boolean logic gates, can be built to process input parameters in a manner that balances the number of ON transistors while simultaneously maintaining a data-independent number of transistor transitions during computation. Leakage reduction may be used with other countermeasures, including introducing noise, unrelated to data being processed, into the power measurements.","Classifications

Cryptographic system and methodology for creating and managing crypto policy on certificate servers,US6336186B1,"A cryptosystem having a Certificate (Key) Server for storing and maintaining certificate or key information in a certificate database is described. The Certificate Server allows clients to submit and retrieve keys from a database based on a set of policy constraints which are set for one's particular site (e.g., company). Access to the Certificate Server is maintained by a Certificate Policy Agent, which makes sure that the policy is enforced for a given site based on the information supplied during the configuration. During operation, the Certificate Server responds to client requests to add, search for, and retrieve certificates. The server accepts or rejects certificates based on configurable parameters enforced by a Certificate Policy Agent. When a certificate is submitted to the server, the Certificate Policy Agent checks to see if it meets the criteria for a given site based on the settings specified during the configuration. Exemplary types of checks that the Certificate Policy Agent can enforce include checking to see if the key has been signed by the appropriate entities and checking to see if the signatures or User IDs associated with a key are approved for submission. If the submission criteria established during the configuration are met, the key is accepted by the server. If the key being submitted does not pass the policy requirements, it is rejected and (optionally) a copy is placed in a “pending bucket” where the key can subsequently be examined by the system administrator to determine if the key should be allowed on the server.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for conducting crypto-ignition processes between thin client devices and server devices over data networks,US6263437B1,"A crypto-ignition process is needed to establish an encrypted communication protocol between two devices connected by an insecure communication link. The present invention introduces a method of creating an identical secret key to two communicating parties is conducted between a thin device and a server computer over an insecure data network. The thin device generally has limited computing power and working memory and the server computer may communicate with a plurality of such thin devices. To ensure the security of the secret key on both sides and reduce traffic in the network, only a pair of public values is exchanged between the thin device and the server computer over the data network. Each side generates its own secret key from a self-generated private value along with the received counterpart's public value according to a commonly used key agreement protocol, such as the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol. To ensure that the generated secret keys are identical on both sides, a verification process is followed by exchanging a message encrypted by one of two generated secret keys. The secret keys are proved to be identical and secret when the encrypted message is successfully decrypted by the other secret key. To reduce network traffic, the verification process is piggybacked with a session request from the thin device to establish a secure and authentic communication session with the server computer. The present invention enables the automatic delivery of the secret keys, without requiring significant computing power and working memory, between each of the thin clients respectively with the server computer.","Classifications

Absolute public key cryptographic system and method surviving private-key compromise with other advantages,US7088821B2,"The present invention presents a public key cryptographic system and method called Absolute Public Key Cryptography that survives private key compromise and offers two-way communication security. Communications are secured even when the private key is revealed. It provides security to the private-to-public side communications and also allows short keys to be used with mobile devices that have low processing power. The system uses keys with two or more components and encrypts a message into the same number of cipher versions. The cipher versions are delivered to the destination in source routing mode, or hop-by-hop routing mode with a small time gap. The recipient performs certain mathematical operations on all the cipher versions and obtains the original message. All the versions are necessary for obtaining the original message. Even a single version missing leads to produce a junk for an attacker. As an attacker at an intermediary IP router can not have all the cipher versions available, he can not obtain the original message even when he knows the private key. This is why the system is called Absolute Public Key Cryptography. The robustness against private key compromise is achieved by blinding the public key through adding a random number to each of its components before encryption. When the encryption process is complete, the random number is discarded and the cipher versions are delivered to the recipient. The effect of blinding is made void by the actual intended recipient, who has all the cipher versions available. Robustness is also achieved another way, that is, by choosing the encrypting key such that each of its components has a common factor with Euler Totient Function of the key modulus, and there is no common factor among all the components. This makes it harder for an attacker to decrypt a single cipher version of the message into the original message and thereby allows smaller keys to be used for mobile communications. Communication in both directions is secured by using two different key pairs, one for public-to-private-side and the other for private-to-public-side communications.","Classifications

For each key recovery agent, the sender generates a key-generating value as a one-way function of the secret value and encrypts the key-generating value with a public key of the key recovery agent. In the second phase, performed for a particular cryptographic session, the sender generates for each key recovery agent a key-encrypting key as a one-way function of the corresponding key-generating value and multiply encrypts the session key with the key-encrypting keys of the key recovery agents. The encrypted key-generating values and the multiply encrypted session key are transmitted together with other recovery information in a manner permitting their interception by a party seeking to recover the secret value. To recover the secret value, the party seeking recovery presents the encrypted key-generating values and public recovery information to the key recovery agents, who decrypt the key-generating values, regenerate the key-encrypting keys from the corresponding key-generating values, and provide the regenerated key-encrypting keys to the recovering party. The recovering party uses the key-encrypting keys to recover the secret value.

The method next performs the step of substituting an updated purse record for the existing purse record in the first list, forming a second list. The method then computes with the updated purse record and the first authentication MDC vector, a second path MDC vector and a second root of the authentication tree for the second list by computing a path MDC vector of the authentication tree between the updated purse record and the first root and stores the second root in the cryptographic facility.","Classifications

Cryptographic system and method for electronic transactions,US7096494B1,"An electronic transaction system, which facilitates secure electronic transactions among multiple parties including cardholders, merchants, and service providers (SP). The system involves electronic cards, commonly known as smart cards, and their equivalent computer software package. The card mimics a real wallet and contains commonly seen financial or non-financial instruments such as a credit card, checkbook, or driver license. A transaction is protected by a hybrid key cryptographic system and is normally carried out on a public network such as the Internet. Digital signatures and challenges-responses are used to ensure integrity and authenticity. The card utilizes secret keys such as session keys assigned by service providers (SPs) to ensure privacy for each transaction. The SP is solely responsible for validating each participant's sensitive information and assigning session keys. The system does not seek to establish a trust relationship between two participants of a transaction. The only trust relationship needed in a transaction is the one that exists between individual participants and the SP. The trust relationship with a participant is established when the SP has received and validated certain established account information from that particular participant. To start a transaction with a selected SP, a participant must have the public key of the intended SP. Since the public key is openly available, its availability can be easily established by the cardholder. The SP also acts as a gateway for the participants when a transaction involves interaction with external systems.","Classifications

Cryptographic technique that provides fast encryption and decryption and assures integrity of a ciphertext message through use of a message authentication code formed through cipher block chaining of the plaintext message,US6226742B1,"A cryptographic technique that not only provides fast and extremely secure encryption and decryption but also assures integrity of a ciphertext message. This technique involves, during message encryption: generating, in response to an incoming plaintext message, an intermediate stream—such as by chaining the message, wherein a predefined portion of the intermediate stream defines a message authentication code (MAC); inserting an encrypted version of the MAC into a predefined portion of a ciphertext message; and generating, in response to the intermediate stream and the encrypted MAC, a remainder of the ciphertext message such that the remainder exhibits a predefined variation, e.g., a pseudo-random sequence, also contained within the encrypted MAC. Decryption proceeds in essentially a reverse fashion. By extending the sequence across the remainder of the ciphertext, any subsequent change to the ciphertext would likely destroy the continuity of the sequence otherwise residing throughout the remainder of the ciphertext. During decryption, any violation to the integrity of the ciphertext can be readily detected by decrypting the MAC contained in the ciphertext and comparing it, for any discrepancies, against a MAC generated from recovered plaintext.","Classifications

A default encryption provider performs encryption and decryption based on a user logon secret such as a password. The default encryption provider also accepts additional entropy from calling application programs. The default encryption provider utilizes a multi-level key encryption scheme to minimize the amount of encryption that has to be re-done when the user changes a password.

Quantum cryptographic system with reduced data loss,US5732139A,"A secure method for distributing a random cryptographic key with reduced data loss. Traditional quantum key distribution systems employ similar probabilities for the different communication modes and thus reject at least half of the transmitted data. The invention substantially reduces the amount of discarded data (those that are encoded and decoded in different communication modes e.g. using different operators) in quantum key distribution without compromising security by using significantly different probabilities for the different communication modes. Data is separated into various sets according to the actual operators used in the encoding and decoding process and the error rate for each set is determined individually. The invention increases the key distribution rate of the BB84 key distribution scheme proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984. Using the invention, the key distribution rate increases with the number of quantum signals transmitted and can be doubled asymptotically.","Classifications

Crypto-pointers for secure data storage,US7185205B2,"The present invention relates to pairing of a different cryptographic key with each pointer in a data structure to form a crypto-pointer. The cryptographic key is used to encrypt the contents of all data stored at the physical location on the storage device indicated by the pointer. Preferably the only data accessible in an unencrypted form is contained in cells that are reachable from root-set crypto-pointers. Once the crypto-pointer associated with a particular memory cell is deleted, normally by overwriting or explicitly zeroing the crypto-pointer, the contents of the memory cell become inaccessible because the data stored at that cell is in encrypted form (cipher text) and the crypto-pointer that included the cryptographic key for decrypting the cipher text has been deleted from the system.","Classifications

"Method and apparatus for cryptographically camouflaged cryptographic key storage, certification and use",US6170058B1,"A digital wallet stores an cryptographically camouflaged access-controlled datum, e.g., a private key encrypted under the user's PIN. Entry of the correct PIN will correctly decrypt the stored key. Entry of certain pseudo-valid PINs will also decrypt the stored key, but improperly so, resulting in a candidate key indistinguishable from the correct key. Such pseudo-valid PINs are spread thinly over the space of PINs, so that the user is unlikely to realize a pseudo-valid PIN via a typographical error in entering the correct PIN. In existing wallet technologies, which lack pseudo-valid PINs, only the correct PIN produces a decrypted key; thus, hackers can find the correct PIN by entering all possible PINs until a key is produced. The present invention's plurality of candidate keys prevent a hacker from knowing when he has found the correct key. In addition, hacker detection may be moved off-line into devices accepting messages signed with candidate keys, and/or the lockout threshold may be increased. Thus, the wallet can be forgiving of typographic or transposition errors, yet a hacker trying large numbers of PINs will eventually guess a pseudo-valid (but still incorrect) PIN and recover a candidate private key whose fraudulent use will be detected. The wallet may be used with associated key generation, certification, and verification technologies. Such technologies may include pseudo-public keys embedded in pseudo-public certificates, i.e., public keys that are not generally known and which are contained in certificates that are verifiable only by entities so authorized by the certifying authority.","Classifications

Digital signature system and method based on a conventional encryption function,US4881264A,"A method of generating digital signatures for signing an infinitely expandable series of messages Mi. An infinitely expandable tree of signature nodes is used, where each node can be used to sign a message. Each node is also used to sign up to k subnodes, where k is an integer greater than one. Each signature used, both for signing messages and for signing subnodes, is a one time signature, which in the preferred embodiment is based on a one-way function F. The function F is made public. To sign a message Mi the signer selects a previously unused node (i.e., node i) from the signature tree. The message signing key at this node is then used to sign this message. The sequence of nodes from the root of the tree (i.e. node l) to node i is then used to verify that the message signature is correct and has not been tampered with. Furthermore, this process proves that the message has not been tampered with. Advantages of the invention include the infinite expandability of the signature tree, dependable verification of messages based on the use of secure one time signatures (e.g., which may be based on one way functions), the small amount of computation required to set up a signature tree, the small amount of storage required to maintain a tree, and the ability to implement the invention using high speed conventional encryption equipment and methods.","Classifications

The method and apparatus preferably operate on an information stream which may comprise message information, authentication information, and random or pseudo-random information. The initial secret keys of the system are a collection of dynamical systems, at least one of which is irreversible. These keys operate on states of the dynamical systems into which the message has been encoded. To initialize the encryption, a subset of the secret keys are selected to be current keys, and the desired message is encoded into the initial states. Encryption continues over a plurality of cycles. During each cycle the current keys are applied either backward or forward in time to their current states, over a plurality of sub-cycles. If during an encryption cycle an irreversible dynamical system is iterated in the backward direction, the choice of antecedent states may either be made randomly or according to information from the input information stream. After all encryption cycles have been performed, the current states of the dynamical system constitute the ciphertext. The ciphertext may then be decrypted by a method similar to the encryption method. In the preferred embodiment, random noise is diffused into the plaintext during encryption, and eliminated during decryption.

Public key cryptosystem key management based on control vectors,US5200999A,"A data processing system, method and program are disclosed, for managing a public key cryptographic system. The method includes the steps of generating a first public key and a first private key as a first pair in the data processing system, for use with a first public key algorithm and further generating a second public key and a second private key as a second pair in the data processing system, for use with a second public key algorithm. The method then continues by assigning a private control vector for the first private key and the second private key in the data processing system, for defining permitted uses for the first and second private keys. Then the method continues by forming a private key record which includes the first private key and the second private key in the data processing system, and encrypting the private key record under a first master key expression which is a function of the private control vector. The method then forms a private key token which includes the private control vector and the private key record, and stores the private key token in the data processing system.
 At a later time, the method receives a first key use request in the data processing system, requiring the first public key algorithm. In response to this, the method continues by accessing the private key token in the data processing system and checking the private control vector to determine if the private key record contains a key having permitted uses which will satisfy the first request. The method then decrypts the private key record under the first master key expression in the data processing system and extracts the first private key from the private key record. The method selects the first public key algorithm in the data processing system for the first key use request and executes the first public key algorithm in the data processing system using the first private key to perform a cryptographic operation to satisfy the first key use request.","Classifications

An XOR function can be decomposed into functions that can be implemented more efficiently. A two-level multiplexer can be used to preserve a clock cycle during cryptography processing. Key scheduling can be pipelined to allow efficient round key generation.,"Classifications

Method for XZ-elliptic curve cryptography,US7379546B2,"Given a set of elliptic curve points defined over a field F(p) and represented in projective coordinate, a method is presented which allows the embedding of data bits in both the X-coordinate and the Z-coordinate of the elliptic curve point when represented in projective coordinate. This makes the number of points that satisfy an elliptic curve equation and which can be used in the corresponding cryptosystem proportional to p2 rather than p. This can be used to either increase security by making the bit positions where data bits are embedded known only to the sender and receiver. Alternatively, it can be used to increase the number of data bits that can be encrypted per single elliptic curve point encryption. In another alternative, it can also be used to reduce p. Also, it can be used as a countermeasure by randomizing the bit positions where data bits are embedded. A similar formulation can be developed for elliptic curves over fields F(2m), as well as special elliptic curves such as Montgomery curves.","Classifications

Method and system for quorum controlled asymmetric proxy encryption,US6587946B1,"A method of forwarding an encrypted message sent to a primary recipient having a secret key to at least one secondary recipient comprising the steps of sharing portions of the secret key among a predetermined threshold number of proxy servers greater than one, upon receipt of an encrypted message by the predetermined threshold number of proxy servers, each of the predetermined threshold number of proxy servers modifying the message by applying the key portion to the encrypted message, the result of the modification comprising a message secret to the predetermined threshold number of proxy servers but decryptable by at least one secondary recipient, and forwarding the resultant message to at least one secondary recipient. This method and system for quorum controlled asymmetric proxy encryption has uses ranging from efficient key distribution for pay-tv, to methods for distributively maintaining databases. The scheme, which can use either an ElGamal, or an ElGamal encryption based on Elliptic Curves or an ElGamal related encryption algorithm, leaks no information as long as there is no dishonest quorum of proxy servers.","Classifications

Variable size block ciphers,US5727062A,"Data blocks of various size can be processed in fast, effective block cipher mechanisms. Variable size confusion layers and variable size diffusion layers combine to form variable size block ciphers. Block size can set (typically byte-by-byte) at design time or dynamically during operation.
 The embodiment of FIG. 1 consists of horizontal layers alternating between confusion and diffusion. Here, each confusion layer, such as the layer including byte-wide substitution operation (16), uses keyed substitution tables which are initialized prior to operation. Simple and fast diffusion layers, such as the layer including byte-wide exclusive-OR (20), generally diffuse in just one direction. Consequently, multiple diffusion layers are usually required, such as those including byte-wide exclusive-OR operations (28) and (36). This kind of diffusion is unusual in a block cipher because it is extremely weak. However, because it can cover the entire block in a single layer, it is unexpectedly advantageous when combined with confusion layers.
 The resulting variable size block ciphers are unusually fast and can be made arbitrarily strong. These ciphers can better fit existing applications, reduce overhead, and directly support large and efficient data blocks. Block size can be expanded dynamically, with good overall diffusion, without adding processing layers. These ciphers support better testing and analysis than previous designs, and also support unexpected new techniques for dynamic keying and authentication.","Classifications

Each source generates content descriptors for each differentiable topic in a tree structured hierarchy, and obtains a multicast address and a content mask for the broadest content descriptor it is capable of distributing. Each recipient obtains the associated source, multicast address, and content mask, for each content descriptor of interest, and uses that information to join the multicast distribution tree for that information. Each network element between the source and the recipient determines what information it must forward for further distribution in response to the content descriptors, content masks, multicast addresses, and multicast distribution trees.","Classifications

Semantic user interface,US5974413A,"A system and method that allows a user to use their everyday language or user defined words to operate a computer in a highly efficient way. In short, every word, letter, control character and symbol is potentially actionable. A computer user's productivity is dramatically increased by making available those functions that enable a user to produce most of his work through simple, language-based commands. The present invention provides an intuitive interface, referred to as a semantic user interface (SUI), that enhances the operation of the current standard window-based interface in a manner that is simple, richer and natural. By leveraging all of the richness and power inherent in a user's language, the present invention provides an important tool that allows the personal computer to operate in a manner that is much closer to our natural way of interacting. A user is allowed to enter ""commands"" in his everyday natural language in order to control the operations of the computer. All commands are language-based and user-defined. These commands can be entered from any context of the user's computer (e.g., any application or operating system workspace). The commands allows a user to launch applications and navigate within applications by using language rather than clicks from a pointing device such as a mouse. It also allows the replacement of keystrokes with stored words or keystrokes. The system also keeps a complete archive record of all the text content the user provides as input, regardless of which application program or operating system window the user is operating in at the time. The combined set of all user defined commands and the memory of all the input text that is stored in the archive constitutes the personality profile and is transportable from one computer to another.","Classifications

Each spot is located by an iterative technique in which a corresponding centroid is located in a box drawn on the image data, a smaller box is defined around the centroid, the centroid is located in the smaller box, and so on. The wavefront aberration is calculated from the centroid locations by using a matrix in which unusable data can be eliminated simply by eliminating rows of the matrix. Aberrations for different pupil sizes are handled in data taken for a single pupil size by renormalization.","Classifications

Collimator for x-ray spectroscopy,US5768339A,"The invention claimed is a collimator for x-rays and the fabrication process for said collimator. The collimator, in its preferred embodiment, displays the general shape of a tube, having two apertures, an entrance aperture and an exit aperture. The walls of the collimator tube are not parallel to each other but rather are paraboloidal in longitudinal section. The geometry of the collimator tube is, therefore, circular in transverse cross-section and paraboloidal in longitudinal section, thereby resulting in a tube whose entrance aperture is of a smaller diameter than its exit aperture. The collimator geometry described is referred to herein as a tubular paraboloid. The preferred embodiment comprises a first tubular paraboloid, or first reflector, and a second tubular paraboloid, or second reflector, each having an outer surface and an ultrasmooth, reflecting inner surface, the second reflector being of smaller diameter than the first reflector and being held by suitable means in assembly concentrically with the first reflector, thereby defining an entrance aperture and an exit aperture. Alternate embodiments may employ more than two nested paraboloid reflectors and may also comprise a truncated cone reflector at the entrance aperture to provide a two reflection figure. In addition, the process developed is suitable for fabrication of optics with very small apertures and ultra smooth interior reflecting surfaces. Many types of reflecting surfaces may be produced, including gold, copper, nickel, palladium and others. The process is a replication method, so that once a master surface for an optic has been prepared, subsequent copies can be inexpensively reproduced. Thus, the fabrication process described is best suited for the production of many identical optics, rather than one-of-a-kind devices, and in a variety of unusual geometries in addition to tubular paraboloids.","Classifications

More particularly, the present invention relates to improvements in the design and fabrication of coded aperture masks for use in coded aperture imaging devices. Improvements can be made to the resolution, for instance, by selecting smaller pixel sizes for the opaque and transparent elements of the coded aperture mask.

The overall contrast range of the recovered information is equal to the applied smoothing factor and can be automatically brought to the full visual intensity range by linear contrast stretching. This has the advantage of maintaining detail contrast proportions which closely reflect the raw data characteristics. If high pixel accuracy processing is provided, ""detail slicing"" becomes possible. Two smoothed images, each processed with a different smoothing factor, can be subtracted providing the information difference between least smoothed and the most smoothed data set.","Classifications

Low-resistivity photon-transparent window attached to photo-sensitive silicon detector,US6025585A,"The invention comprises a combination of a low resistivity, or electrically conducting, silicon layer that is transparent to long or short wavelength photons and is attached to the backside of a photon-sensitive layer of silicon, such as a silicon wafer or chip. The window is applied to photon sensitive silicon devices such as photodiodes, charge-coupled devices, active pixel sensors, low-energy x-ray sensors and other radiation detectors. The silicon window is applied to the back side of a photosensitive silicon wafer or chip so that photons can illuminate the device from the backside without interference from the circuit printed on the frontside. A voltage sufficient to fully deplete the high-resistivity photosensitive silicon volume of charge carriers is applied between the low-resistivity back window and the front, patterned, side of the device. This allows photon-induced charge created at the backside to reach the front side of the device and to be processed by any circuitry attached to the front side. Using the inventive combination, the photon sensitive silicon layer does not need to be thinned beyond standard fabrication methods in order to achieve full charge-depletion in the silicon volume. In one embodiment, the inventive backside window is applied to high resistivity silicon to allow backside illumination while maintaining charge isolation in CCD pixels.","Classifications

Radiation propagates through, interacts with, exits the medium and the object, and is detected/imaged. Image quality can be improved if radiation is collimated and/or if transmission and/or backscattered measurements from a number of perspectives are used to improved image reconstruction. Coupling materials can be employed during image acquisition to enhance radiation coupling as well as providing desirable absorption and scattering properties. Contrast materials and agents can also aid in the detection of concealed objects. Adaptive methods, e.g. using reference objects, including implementations based on the concept of guide stars, can improve the imaging process. The surface can be monitored and groomed to enhance the imaging process. Tomosynthesis techniques can be used to reconstruct images. Acousto-optic effects may be observed when both optical radiation and acoustic radiation are introduce into the medium. A laser vibrometry, speckle, or holographic interferometry imaging technique can be used to readout the acoustic waveform exiting the medium surface directly or after interacting with a deformable mirrored or reflective layer coupled to the medium. The medium may be prepared prior to imaging in order to reduce surface irregularities and roughness.

Changes in core body temperature may be stimulated by the administration of food or certain organic and drug-related substances or stress to induce a change in basal metabolic rate over time. These changes correlate directly with a human subject's metabolism rate at rest and under certain dietary constraints and can be used to determine courses of treatment for obesity, metabolic disease, and other disorders.

Scanning horn-reflector antenna,US3021524A,"889,490. Aerials; radio direction-finding. WESTERN ELECTRIC CO. Inc. May 25, 1960 [May 28, 1959], No. 18454/60. Class 40(7). A directional aerial system capable of providing signals for automatic tracking comprises a waveguide horn radiator feeding a paraboloidal reflector, with an elongated body of dielectric material mounted between the two for rotation about the horn axis. As described a circular waveguide (not shown) feeds a square-section waveguide horn 10, a rotatable joint being provided. The horn 10 is directed towards a paraboloidal reflector 42 and has an aperture in its upper surface through which energy can pass. The radiofrequency stages of a transducer, which may be a receiver for radio astronomy investigation, are mounted in an enclosure 24. A disc 22 mounts the smaller end of the horn for rotation in the front wall of this enclosure and the larger end of the horn carries disc 14 supported by rollers 16 and 18 so that the horn and reflector assembly can be rotated about the horn axis by motor 36, reduction gearing 20 and belt 38 asnecessary for alignment and tracking. The aerial system is carried on a turntable 12 rotatable by motor 28 for movement in azimuth for the same purpose. To provide a conical scan for automatic tracking an elongated bi-conical body 44 of dielectric material is mounted within the horn 10 so that its axis makes an angle with the horn axis. This body is supported at its centre by an oblique conical structure 46 of material of low dielectric constant mounted for rotation in rollers 48. A motor 50 is provided to drive the support 46 and thus rotate the body 44 round the horn axis. The dielectric material used to form body 44 may be a ferrite and whilst it is not essential to use a bi-conical shape tapering is 'desirable to reduce reflections.","Classifications

Unitary space transit,US3940859A,"An instrument is provided which requires no complex computations or high degree of skill in aligning scales to accurately indicate the time of day from observations of the position of the sun, and to accurately locate the moon, the sun, and other stars and constellations in celestial space.
 The instrument comprises a vertically adjustable stand upon which is mounted a support plane which may be rotated about a horizontal axis to accommodate alignment with the celestial equator. To the support plate is mounted a single rotary disk rotatable about a principal axis normal to the plane of the support plate. Inscribed upon the surface of the disk are an hour scale, a month-day scale, a right ascension hour angle scale, a local hour angle scale, a moon phase scale, a lunation scale to trace the phases of the moon, and a zodiac constellation display.
 Integrally formed from and normal to the disk are a sunbeam aperture plate, a sunbeam trace plate, and a plate having a declination scale inscribed thereon and to which a space object pointer with a bubble level is rotatably attached. Inscribed on the surface of the sunbeam trace plate opposite the aperture plate are time equation graphs tracing the movement of the sun in both the northern and southern celestial hemispheres. Sun declination scales and mean sun base lines corresponding to each time graph are also inscribed on the trace plate.
 When the support plate is aligned with its face toward the north and parallel to the plane of the celestial equator, the rotary disk may be turned to a position where sunlight passes through an aperture of the sunbeam aperture plate to strike a time equation graph or a mean sun base line inscribed on the trace plate. A rotary meridian marker mounted to the support plate so as to rotate about its principal axis independent of the rotary disk may then be used to directly indicate standard time, daylight saving time, solar time, or mean solar time on the hour scale.
 To function as a space transit, the rotary disk may be adjusted for longitudinal correction and right ascension, and the space object pointer may be adjusted for declination to locate the moon, sun, planets and other stars and constellations in space. Conversely, after the instrument has been directed toward an object in space, the instrument may be adjusted to indicate the right ascension and declination of the object. In addition, the constellations of the zodiac may be more generally located by means of the zodiac constellation display and a knowledge of the sun's declination during the month of concern.
 The moon phase and lunation interval scales make possible the tracing of any moon phase throughout the current and subsequent years. Further, when the date of the moon phase is determined, the right ascension and hour angle of the moon at any given time during the phase may be acquired.","Classifications

The present method is based on the discovery that, when irradiated with a beam of infrared, monochromatic light, malignant tumor tissue, benign tumor tissue, and normal or benign tissue produce distinguishable Raman spectra. For human breast tissue, some salient differences in the respective Raman spectra are the presence of four Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1078, 1300, 1445, and 1651 cm-1 for normal or benign tissue, the presence of three Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1240, 1445, and 1659 cm-1 for benign tumor tissue, and the presence of two Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1445 and 1651 cm-1 for malignant tumor tissue. In addition, it was discovered that for human breast tissue the ratio of intensities of the Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1445 and 1659 cm-1 is about 1.25 for normal or benign tissue, about 0.93 for benign tumor tissue, and about 0.87 for malignant tumor tissue.","Classifications

After a high resolution CT scan and angiogram or MRI, data is incorporated and analyzed by a computer. This information is then resynthesized and projected as a video image on a screen facing the surgeon. A small magnetic object, perhaps a ball, is inserted into the patient's head via a burr hole drilled through the patient's skull. Using, real time fluoroscopic data superimposed on the computer image of three-dimensional structures, the surgeon is able to control and manipulate the object through the patient's soft brain tissue to a position next to or inside of the tumor area. An energy beam is then fired at the object, causing the more heat efficient object to destroy the brain tumor area. This procedure is repeated until the entire tumor is eradicated by the highly localized hyperthermia.

Application of light at plural treatment sites within a tumor to increase the efficacy of light therapy,US6416531B2,"Light is administered during photodynamic therapy (PDT) for an extended period of time at a plurality of sites distributed within the abnormal tissue of a tumor. A clinical study has shown that a substantially greater volume of abnormal tissue in a tumor is destroyed by the extended administration of light therapy from a plurality of probes than would have been expected based upon the teaching of the prior art. In this process, a plurality of light emitting optical fibers or probes are deployed in a spaced-apart array. After a photoreactive agent is absorbed by the abnormal tissue, the light therapy is administered for at least three hours. The greater volume of necrosis in the tumor is achieved due to one or more concomitant effects, including: the inflammation of damaged abnormal tissue and resultant immunological response of the patient's body; the diffusion and circulation of activated photoreactive agent outside the expected fluence zone, which is believed to destroy the abnormal tissue; a retrograde thrombosis or vascular occlusion outside of the expected fluence zone; and, the collapse of the vascular system that provides oxygenated blood to portions of the tumor outside the expected fluence zone. In addition, is possible that molecular oxygen diffusing and circulating into the expected fluence zone is converted to singlet oxygen during the extended light therapy, causing a gradient of hypoxia and anoxia that destroys the abnormal tissue outside the expected fluence zone.","Classifications

The apparatus employs an ultraviolet light source with an emitting waveband of 3000A-4000A. Light from the light source is transmitted through a bundle of quartz optic fibers to the surface of the tumor, whether benign or malignant, to stimulate it, which then generates a specific intrinsic fluorescence spectrum. The intrinsic fluorescence spectrum reflected from the surface of the tumor is transmitted by a second bundles of glass fibers placed near it to a color resolution means, then processed by a scanning means and a circuit means, and displayed recorded by a display recording means. The display may be a graphic presentation of the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of the tumor that is tested. If the graphic presentation displayed includes a single peak within the range of the blue color band, it indicates that the tumor being tested is benign. If however, a second peak appears within the range of the red color band of the graphic presentation it is a characteristic peak of malignancy, indicating the existence of a malignant tumor.

Tumor targeting with polymeric molecules having extended conformation,US5762909A,"Enhanced drug delivery to tumor tissue is obtained by attaching drug molecules to elongated polypeptide carrier molecules several orders of magnitude longer than wide. These are chosen to have a high net negative charge. The carrier molecules are created by unfolding long polypeptides by a large degree of substitution with steric hindrance molecules, such as diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) with at least 90% substitution. This causes the conformation to be worm-like as evidenced by a measure of persistence length, with a diameter small enough squeeze through the pore structures of tumor tissue but not so small as to pass through pores of vessels in normal tissue. The length is determined by optimizing two processes, blood circulation lifetime, and tumor uptake. The elongated conformation may cause the complex to become entwined with stroma in tumor interstitium and become trapped. The complex molecules provides increased therapeutic benefit in effecting tumor tissue destruction, or may be used in enhancing imaging contrast depending upon the active agent attached to the carrier molecules. The enhanced concentration and retention of the complex molecules within the tumor reduces side effects of the active agent in other tissues.","Classifications

Glycosaminoglycan derivatives and their use as inhibitors of tumor invasiveness of metastatic profusion-II,US5262403A,"The present invention comprises a method for impeding the formation of tumor metastasis or tumor invasiveness in a host. Such inhibition comprises administration to the host of a glycosaminoglycan derivative substantially devoid of anticoagulation activity and is an effective inhibitory of heparanase activity. Such a glycosaminoglycan derivative may be provided by purchase or synthesis as directed herein. Parenteral administration to a tumor-bearing host of the glycosaminoglycan derivative results in the exposure of host-borne tumor cells thereto. Such exposure to effective levels of the derivative results in the inhibition of tumor heparanase activity and a lessening of invasiveness and metastatic spread.
 Heparin, a glycosaminoglycan particularly effective as a heparanase inhibitor and an anti-clotting agent, is a preferred glycosaminoglycan for derivatization. Upon derivatization according to the present invention heparin may be converted into a glycosaminglycan derivative substantially devoid of anticoagulant activity but yet being an effective inhibitor of heparanase activity. Mere reduction of heparin carboxyl groups results in the production of a glycosaminoglycan derivative inhibitory to heparanase activity but without substantially anticoagulant activity non-anticoagulating, heparanase-inhibiting glycosaminoglycan derivatives may also be prepared from heparin, for example, by: at least partial N-desulfation and then N-acetylation; or N-, O-desulfation followed by N-resulfation.","Classifications

Method for selection of primate tumor-associated antigens suitable as in vivo targets for antibodies,US5049373A,"The present invention is a process for the selection of antigens which are suitable targets for in vivo antibody localization in human tumors or other altered (or diseased) tissue. The process provides a simplified and rapid technique for discovering useful in vivo targets for antibodies and is useful in cancer detection and therapy in humans or other primates, whether or not the antigens are specific to tumors. More specifically, the invention relates to a process for the selection of antigens suitable as targets for antibodies which localize in a tumor in vivo in which antibodies are first prepared distinguishable from those present in the animal in which biofiltration is to occur and that bind to antigens present in the tumor to be targeted. These antibodies are then injected into a non-tumor-bearing primate, into a tumor-bearing animal, and into a non-tumor bearing animal of the same species as the tumor-bearing animal to permit biofiltration of the antibodies. The biofiltered antibodies are next recovered from each of the non-tumor-bearing primate, the tumor-bearing animal, and the non-tumor-bearing animal and are employed to identify antigens whose antibodies are not retained in vivo in the primate and the non-tumor-bearing animal. The antibodies that are not retained in vivo by the non-tumor-bearing primate and the non-tumor bearing animal are then compared with those antibodies that are actually retained in vivo in the tumor-bearing animal to identify the antigens corresponding to those antibodies that are selectively retained in the tumor-bearing animal. In an alternative process, the tumor-bearing animal may be replaced by a perfusable surgically removed human organ bearing a tumor, and the non-tumor-bearing animal may be replaced by a surgically removed normal organ. Passage through a primate, however, remains the method of choice for selecting antigens whose antibodies are unabsorbed in vivo.","Classifications

Treatment of melanoma with a vaccine comprising irradiated autologous melanoma tumor cells conjugated to a hapten,US5290551A,"The invention is a haptenized tumor vaccine for the treatment of cancer. Treatment of cancer patients with an autologous, vaccine preceded by low dose cyclophosphamide (CY) induces delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to melanoma cells, and in some cases, regression of metastatic tumors. The efficiency of the process has been increased by immunizing with tumor cells conjugated to the hapten such as DNP, TNP or AED.
 Additional embodiments of the vaccine include: 1) combining the vaccine with immunomodulating drugs, such as, interleukin-2 (IL2); and 2) purifying the active components of the vaccine by extracting antigens from cancer cells to produce a chemically-defined, haptenated vaccine. The treatment may also be extended to include other types of human cancer.","Classifications
